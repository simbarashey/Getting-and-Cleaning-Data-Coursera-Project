# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Submission

This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project with instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

## Files

1. `CodeBook.md` is a codebook containing the descrptions of the variables
2. `run_analysis.R` is an R script that performs the following sequence of transformations on the data:
 + Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 + Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 + From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. `finaldata.txt` is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
